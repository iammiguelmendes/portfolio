                 My grade was 18 (0-20).

                <h4 class="text-start">Difficulties</h4>
                  <p class="text-start">Since this was a fictional brand, I needed to determine the branding of the bakery which included creating an identity, how the identity would be transmited, how would the website translate the bakery's values into visuals and how the user would relate to it.

                  <p class="text-start">I learned that branding is a subject that most UX designers should also understand, and not restrict it to graphic designers. There needs to be a connection between the identity of the brand and how it is shown to the user.

                      It believes that to simply eating the food is not enough, you need to be in the building, mixing everything you see with how you are treated and how delicious the food is.<br>
                      It wants to have a design that reflects its values, without many words.</p>

                    <h1 class="pt-2">Problem</h1>
                   <p>Bakery had no online presence and no way to claim the prestige it was desired to have.<br>
                      It needed to make sure people understood right away, without reading, without thinking much, that the product would be delicious, an experience, expensive but worth it.<br>
                      You can't have an identity if you have no presence and no direction to go.

                    <h1 class="pt-2">Solution</h1>
                    <p>The design itself was made in a very minimalistic style, using only 2 colors, simple typography but elegant with a lot of white space.<br><br>
                    <span style="font-weight: 600;">Why?</span><br>
                    The two colors are associated with luxury, with rustic places (which are seen as having more natural food). 
                    The bakery is high end, so who is the customer? People with a certain financial level, which normally are busy workers or entrepeneurs, so their free time is after work or after dinner, which means mostly at night. Porto at night is full of yellow lights, combining with the dark sky, you have the colors of the bakery, perfectly blended for all the right reasons.<br>
                    Since the customer is obviously the user, the website needs to be simple with a lot of white space, so that people who are older or have small digital experience, can navigate in the website, which makes it feel as a high end website also.

                Normally a bakery takes orders and delivers the food home, but not this one. Docelene is high end, the bakery's building and landscape is part of the experience, so it does not have delivery at home.<br>
                Instead, it has catering services and is present in weddings and ceremonies of that style.</p>

                    <h1 class="pt-2">Design style guide</h1>
                    <p>A design style guide was made for two reasons.<br><br>
                      First, it is important to understand what it is and to see it, because every brand has an identity and a UX designer should know the which typography  is used, the colors, where can the logo be placed, and every detail in the guide, which is crucial.<br><br>
                      Second, it helped me see if I was missing something. In design, an identity is a group of details, so I needed to have a group of details defined so that if another designer would work with me, I didn't have to explain everything from scratch.

                <hr class="mt-2 mb-5">
                <div class="container">
                  <div class="row pt-5">

                    <h1 class="pt-2">Name</h1>
                    <p>So with the name I thought of the word "doce" which means "sweet" in portuguese, already making people know in what type of niche the business is.<br><br>
                      In Portugal when the food doesn't do good to your health we say it is heavy, and if the food is not very harmful we say it is light or soft. In portuguese (in this context) "leve" means "light" or "soft", but I wanted a more exclusive word.<br> 
                      I went to check synonyms of "leve" that people normally don't use, and "lene" is a synonym and also means healthy.<br><br>
                      So I created Docelene, which as I said, indicates the type of niche the business is in and also indicates it is heathy.

                    <h1 class="pt-2">Logo</h1>
                    <p>For the logo I wanted something equally minimalistic but with meaning.<br>
                    Check the picture at the right, the line is actually Rio Douro, the famous river of Porto, where the bakery is fictionally located close to.<br><br>
                    It is a small detail that gives a whole new meaning to the logo and is an expandable logo.<br><br>
                    What I mean with that is, if the bakery would expand to other places, even around the world, every place would have some minimalistic line that would represent something of that location, and the main logo would just be the name for example.<br>
                    <br>
                    I also made a submark logo in case of the logo being too big in certain places like small cards or small dimension in a website.</p>
