              <h4 class="pt-5">Goal</h4>
              <p>This fictional bakery is a high end bakery, specialized in muffins, which has a goal of being known as the most elegant and prestige bakery in Porto.<br>
              It needs to have a design that reflects its values.</p>
              <h4 class="pt-4">Problem</h4>
              <p>Bakery had no online presence and no way to claim the prestige it was desired to have.<br>
              It needed a way to make sure people understood right away, without reading, without thinking much, that the product would be delicious, an experience, expensive but worth it.
              </p>
              <h4 class="pt-4">Solution</h4>
              <p>The design itself was made in a very minimalistic style, using only 2 colors that are associated with luxury, simple typography but elegant with a lot of white space.<br>
                Normally a bakery takes orders and delivers the food home, but not this one. Docelene is high end, the bakery's building and landscape is part of the experience, so it does not have delivery at home.<br>
                Instead, it has catering services and is present in weddings and ceremonies of that style.
              <h4 class="pt-4">My influence</h4>
              <p> Since the bakery is fictional, I decided how the business would be done (catering, values of the bakery and more), which is not easy but I enjoy that, good design is good business.<br>
                I also decided that the web design and logo design, had to have a very defined style so that even without a logo or many words, people would recognize the bakery in any platform (website, social media, newsletters, google ads).<br>
              Dispite the fact that this project includes certain things considered outside of the UX/UI area, it is important to understand a bit of business and branding.</p>
              <h4 class=" pt-4 learn-div">Difficulties/What I learned</h4>
              <p>Since it was a bootcamp project of a fictional bakery, I had to think of how the business would be done knowing that it needed to be a high end bakery.<br>
              Also there are no real users, so I tried to imagine what the pain, needs, motivations and fears of an ideal or possible customer and how they would relate to the product. I then designed based on that information for their best possible experience using the product.</p>
