                  <h4 class="text-start">Type of project</h4>
                <p class="text-start">This is a 2 weeks, solo project that was made in my UX/UI bootcamp, with the objective of making a design that shows a brand's identity.<br>
                 My grade was 18 (0-20).

              <div class="col-lg-4 col-md-4 col-12">
                <h4 class="text-start">Difficulties</h4>
                  <p class="text-start">Since this was a fictional brand, I needed to determine the branding of the bakery which included creating an identity, how the identity would be transmited, how would the website translate the bakery's values into visuals and how the user would relate to it.

              <div class="col-lg-4 col-md-4 col-12">
                  <h4 class="text-start">What I learned</h4>
                  <p class="text-start">I learned that branding is a subject that most UX designers should also understand, and not restrict it to graphic designers. There needs to be a connection between the identity of the brand and how it is shown to the user.

                   <p>Bakery had no online presence and no way to claim the prestige it was desired to have.<br>
              It needed a way to make sure people understood right away, without reading, without thinking much, that the product would be delicious, an experience, expensive but worth it.
